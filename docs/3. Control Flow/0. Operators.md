#  Operators
Certainly! Here's the corrected header:

### Types of Operators

Now, let's provide examples for each type of operator:

## 1. Comparison Operators:
   - `==` (Equality Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     int y = 5;
     if (x == y) {
         print("x is equal to y");
     }
     ```
   - `!=` (Inequality Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     int y = 10;
     if (x != y) {
         print("x is not equal to y");
     }
     ```
   - `>` (Greater Than Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 10;
     int y = 5;
     if (x > y) {
         print("x is greater than y");
     }
     ```
   - `<` (Less Than Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     int y = 10;
     if (x < y) {
         print("x is less than y");
     }
     ```
   - `>=` (Greater Than or Equal To Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 10;
     int y = 10;
     if (x >= y) {
         print("x is greater than or equal to y");
     }
     ```
   - `<=` (Less Than or Equal To Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     int y = 10;
     if (x <= y) {
         print("x is less than or equal to y");
     }
     ```

## 2. Assignment Operators:
   - `=` (Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     ```
   - `+=` (Addition Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     x += 3; // equivalent to: x = x + 3;
     ```
   - `-=` (Subtraction Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 10;
     x -= 3; // equivalent to: x = x - 3;
     ```
   - `*=` (Multiplication Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 5;
     x *= 2; // equivalent to: x = x * 2;
     ```
   - `/=` (Division Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     double x = 10.0;
     x /= 2; // equivalent to: x = x / 2;
     ```
   - `%=` (Modulus Assignment Operator): 
     ```javascript
     int x = 10;
     x %= 3; // equivalent to: x = x % 3;
     ```

## 3. Logical Operators:
   - `&&` (Logical AND Operator): 
     ```javascript
     bool isSunny = true;
     bool isWarm = true;
     if (isSunny && isWarm) {
         print("It's sunny and warm outside");
     }
     ```
   - `||` (Logical OR Operator): 
     ```javascript
     bool isRaining = true;
     bool isSnowing = false;
     if (isRaining || isSnowing) {
         print("It's either raining or snowing");
     }
     ```
   - `!` (Logical NOT Operator): 
     ```javascript
     bool isCloudy = true;
     if (!isCloudy) {
         print("It's not cloudy");
     }
     ```
