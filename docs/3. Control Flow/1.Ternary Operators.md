# Ternary Operators
Ternary operators, also known as conditional expressions, provide a concise way to write simple conditional statements in many programming languages, including Dart. The ternary operator has the following syntax:

```dart
condition ? expr1 : expr2
```

Here's what each part represents:
- `condition`: This is the expression that you want to evaluate. If this expression is true, `expr1` is evaluated; otherwise, `expr2` is evaluated.
- `expr1`: The value to be returned if the condition evaluates to true.
- `expr2`: The value to be returned if the condition evaluates to false.

```javascript
int x = 10;
String message = x > 5 ? "x is greater than 5" : "x is less than or equal to 5";
print(message); // Output: x is greater than 5
```

In this example:
- `x > 5` is the condition.
- `"x is greater than 5"` is `expr1`.
- `"x is less than or equal to 5"` is `expr2`.

Since `x` is `10`, which is greater than `5`, the condition `x > 5` evaluates to `true`, so the expression returns `"x is greater than 5"`.
