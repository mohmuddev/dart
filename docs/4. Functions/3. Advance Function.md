# Advance  function 


## Anonymous function 



Anonymous functions in Dart are unnamed functions used for short tasks without needing a separate name. They're handy for passing functions as arguments, handling asynchronous operations, concise code, event handling, and conditional operations.


```javascript
void main() {
    var sayHI = (name) => 'Hi, $name!';

    var callfunction = sayHI("Andrea");

    print(callfunction);
}
```

```javascript
void main(){
  var callFunction = sayHI('Andrea');
  print(callFunction);
}

var sayHI = (String name){
  return 'Hi $name';
};


```
