# Advance  function 


## Anonymous function 



Anonymous functions in Dart are unnamed functions used for short tasks without needing a separate name. They're handy for passing functions as arguments, handling asynchronous operations, concise code, event handling, and conditional operations.


```javascript
void main() {
    var sayHI = (name) => 'Hi, $name!';

    var callfunction = sayHI("Andrea");

    print(callfunction);
}
```

```javascript
void main(){
  var callFunction = sayHI('Andrea');
  print(callFunction);
}

var sayHI = (String name){
  return 'Hi $name';
};


```

## Function as fist class Object

Functions are considered first-class citizens in a programming language when they can be treated as any other value, such as numbers or strings. 

1. **Functions can be assigned to variables:** Function is assigned to a variable and can be stored in variables.

2. **Functions can be passed as arguments:** Dart allows passing functions as arguments to other functions. For example, you could have a function that takes another function as an argument.

3. **Functions can be returned from other functions:** Dart allows functions to return other functions as values.

4. **Functions can be stored in data structures:** Functions can be stored in lists, maps, or any other data structures in Dart, just like other types of data.



```javascript title="Functions can be assigned to variables"
  void main() {
  // Assign the function to a variable
  var meanFunction = calculateMean;

  // Use the variable to call the function
  var result = meanFunction(10, 20);
  print('Mean: $result');
}

// Define a function that calculates the mean of two numbers
double calculateMean(int a, int b) {
  return (a + b) / 2;
}
```

```javascript title="Functions can be passed as arguments:"
  void main() {
  var addition = add;
  var result = performOperation(8, 12, addition);
  var result2 = addition(2, 3);

  print('This is the Result_1: $result');
  print('This is the Result_2: $result2');
}

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int performOperation(int x, int y, Function operation) {
  return operation(x, y);
}

}
```



```javascript title="Functions can be returned from other functions"
// This function takes an integer z and returns a function that adds z to the sum of two integers
void main() {
  // Get an addition function that also adds 2 to the sum
  var adderWithExtra = createAdder(2);
  
  // Use the function
  print(adderWithExtra(5, 3)); // Outputs: 10 (5 + 3 + 2)
}

Function createAdder(int z) {
  return (int x, int y) => x + y + z;
}
