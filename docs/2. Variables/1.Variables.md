# Variables
Certainly! Let's delve into each of these topics in Dart:

### 1. Declare Variable:

#### `var` Keyword:
- Allows Dart to infer the type of the variable from the assigned value.
- Example:
  ```Javascript
  var age = 25; // Dart infers that age is of type int
  ```

#### `dynamic` Keyword:
- Declares a variable that can hold values of any type.
- Example:
  ```Javascript
  dynamic value = 10; // value can hold an int
  value = 'Hello'; // value can now hold a String
  ```

### 2. Declare the Type:
In Dart, you can explicitly declare the type of a variable using the type name followed by the variable name.

#### Example:
```Javascript
int age = 25; // age is explicitly declared as an int
String name = 'Alice'; // name is explicitly declared as a String
```

### 3. Dynamic Typing:
Dart is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't always have to specify the type explicitly. Dart can infer the type based on the assigned value.

#### Example:
```Javascript
var age = 25; // age is inferred as int
var name = 'Alice'; // name is inferred as String
```

### 4. Naming Conventions:
Dart follows standard naming conventions for variables.

#### Rules:
- Variable names should begin with a lowercase letter or underscore.
- Use camelCase for multi-word variable names.
- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.

#### Examples:
- `age`
- `userName`
- `totalAmount`
- `_privateVariable`
