# Optional / Nullable Variables

Certainly! Here's an example of declaring a nullable variable `x` and assigning it `null`:

```Javascript
var x = null; // x is a nullable variable initialized with null
```

In this example, `var` is used to declare a variable `x`, and it's initialized with `null`. Since `var` allows Dart to infer the type of the variable based on the assigned value, `x` will be inferred as nullable because it's assigned `null`. 

Alternatively, you can explicitly declare `x` as nullable:

```Javascript
var x; // x is implicitly declared as dynamic
dynamic x = null; // x is explicitly declared as dynamic and initialized with null
```

Both of these examples achieve the same result: `x` is a nullable variable that can hold any type of value or `null`.
